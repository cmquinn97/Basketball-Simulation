# Basketball-Simulation
CS200 final project basketball game simulation

This is simply the source code for my 3rd semester CS 200 final project. This simulates games based on manually inputted player 
ratings, in coordination with a simulation algorithm to provide realistic results.

I have decided to refactor this program in my senior year of college in attempt to show my ability to refactor, and to show the
progression in my learning.
